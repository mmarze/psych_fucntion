2. Unzip the downloaded file. As teh result, you should obtain a folder with two sub-filders: _Palamedes_ and _PalamedesDemos_. _Palamedes_ contains functions that are the part of the Palamedes Toolbox. _PalamedesDemos_ contains expamples of using the toolbox.
3. Using Palamedes in Matlab.
Make sure that the oath to _Palamedes_ folder is set as your working directory in Matlab (in my case: ~/Downloads/Palamedes1_10_11/Palamedes). You can use _pwd_ command in Matlab or simply check it in the GUI.

When running the script in another location, you may get the following message:

Choosing "Add to Path" makes MATLAB support 2 paths - to the location of your script and to the Palamedes Toolbox.
4. You're all set! Enjoy using Palamedes.
